My name is Andrew and I am from Minnesota. I like both watching and playing many sports. I am currently
a student at the University of Wisconsin Madison and I am studying Computer Science and Statistics.

Andrew's favorite hockey team is the Minnesota wild. While they have never won the Stanley Cup yet they may have the chance to
win soon.  Minnesota has a great history of hockey, Herb Brooks who was the coach of the 1980 American olympic hockey team was from Minnesota. 
The team managed to beat the  Russian hockey powerhouse creating one of the biggest upset in hockey history. This story went
on to become a well known story known as the Miracle On Ice.
