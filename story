My name is Andrew and I'm from Minnesota. I am an avid sports fan and love to play baseball, basketball, football, hockey,
and golf. I enjoy being outside and spending time with my friends and family. I am now a student at the University of
Wisconsin - Madison studying Computer Science and Statistics

Andrew's favorite hockey team is the Minnesota wild. While they have never won the Stanley Cup yet they may have the chance to
win soon.  Minnesota has a great history of hockey, Herb Brooks who was the coach of the 1980 American olympic hockey team was from Minnesota. 
The team managed to beat the  Russian hockey powerhouse creating one of the biggest upset in hockey history. This story went
on to become a well known story known as the Miracle On Ice.
